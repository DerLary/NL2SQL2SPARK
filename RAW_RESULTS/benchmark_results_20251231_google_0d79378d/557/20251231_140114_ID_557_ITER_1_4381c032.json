It correctly uses `T2.Age > 65` for an exclusive range.\\n4.  **Data type mismatch in predicates:**\\n    *   `T1.Score > 5`: `Score` is likely an integer type, `5` is an integer. No mismatch.\\n    *   `T2.Age > 65`: `Age` is likely an integer type, `65` is an integer. No mismatch.\\n    *   `T1.OwnerUserId = T2.Id`: Both are typically integer types for join keys. No mismatch.\\n    *   The calculation `(CAST(SUM(...) AS REAL) * 100.0) / COUNT(T1.Id)` correctly handles data types. `SUM` results in `BIGINT`, `CAST(... AS REAL)` converts it to `FLOAT`.

This ensures floating-point division and a precise percentage.\\n5.  **Properly quoting identifiers:** The identifiers used (`Id`, `Age`, `Score`, `OwnerUserId`) are simple and do not contain special characters or reserved keywords, so they do not strictly require backticks (`` ` ``) in Spark SQL.\\n6.  **Use ` for the in-query strings:** There are no string literals in the query.
